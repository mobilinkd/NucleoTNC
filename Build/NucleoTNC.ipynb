    "The Nucleo TNC is a 1200 baud KISS TNC built using an inexpensive microcontroller board with great digital signal processing capabilities and very low power consumption. It's an open implementation of our commercial product, the TNC3, designed to encourage experimentation and learning in electronics and software engineering. It's a more advanced version of a [similar project we designed for the Arduino Nano](http://www.mobilinkd.com/2014/09/11/arduino-kiss-tnc/), which was based on our TNC1/TNC2 product.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nucleo TNC is part of a larger system for sending and receiving digital information over the radio. This TNC is designed for 1200 baud AFSK, which means it is designed to send data over an audio channel -- specifically over a standard FM voice channel.  One of the more popular uses for this is for APRS.  It can also be used for Winlink, or to attach to packet radio BBS systems, and for direct one-on-one communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this TNC you will need the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " * A radio -- typically a hand-held radio or mobile radio.\n",
    " * The TNC itself.\n",
    " * A computer with a USB port or a mobile device (Android, iOS) with a USB-OTG interface.\n",
    "  \n",
    "```\n",
    "    RADIO <-> Nucleo TNC <-> COMPUTER\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " * The radio is responsible for sending and receiving the modulated data signals over the air.\n",
    " * The TNC is responsible for decoding the data received by the radio into packets and sending them to the computer; and for receiving packets from the computer, modulating the signal, and causing the radio to transmit the data over the air.\n",
    " * The computer is responsible dispaying the data in a human-friendly way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the radio is an integral part of this system, the quality of the radio plays a big part in the quality of the system as a whole.  The TNC outlined here is a high-performane TNC that is rendered mediocre with a cheap radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because the computer is an integral part of the system, the software available on the computer and operating systems of choice dictate what packet radio options are available.  For example, as of the time this was written, there is no Winlink software that will work with a KISS TNC on MacOS or Android.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, because Apple restrict USB access via iOS, just as it does with Bluetooth SPP, you cannot access the TNC from an iOS device at this time.  Apple users should complain loudly about this.  It's an asinine policy.\n",

    "This document is divided into a number of sections.  We start with the schematic diagram and theory of operation, then go into the bill of materials, the tools you will need, construction, troubleshooting, and operation.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Theory of Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will discuss all of the section at least briefly, but will focus most of the attention on the audio input and output sections and the PTT circuitry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The audio input and output circuitry share a single quad op-amp IC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The microcontroller (MCU) used in this project is an STM32L432KC on an ST Microelectronics Nucleo-32 board. This has a similar size an pin compatibility with the Arduino Nano.  It contains a Cortex-M4F CPU capable of running at up to 80MHz, a 12-bit analog to digital converter (ADC) capable of over-sampling to achieve up to 16-bit resolution, and a dual-channel 12-bit digital to analog converter (DAC).  It also includes a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) with up to 16X (24dB) amplification.  The MCU has 64KB of static RAM and 256KB of flash program memory.  It is an order of magnitude more capable then the Aduino Nano used in the previous breadboard TNC project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the EEPROM and the quad op amp have 100nF decoupling caps across VDD and GND.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Radio Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "The TNC radio interface consists of a 4-pole (TRRS) 3.5mm phone jack, similar to what is used in most mobile phones (for those that still have headphone jacks).  The 4 poles are referred to as Tip (T), Ring 1 (R1), Ring 2 (R2) and Sleeve (S).  Ring 1 is closest to the tip and ring 2 is closest to the base or sleeve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connector pinout is:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Tip - TNC audio input / radio speaker.\n",
    " * Ring 1 - PTT signal for simplex PTT.  This is used by Kenwood radios and MiniDIN-6 packet interfaces.\n",
    " * Ring 2 - TNC audio output / radio mic+ input, as well as multiplex PTT for Yaesu, Icom, Alinco (and other) radios.\n",
    " * Sleeve - Common ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss the PTT circuitry and options affecting Ring 1 and Ring 2 in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PTT Circuitry\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of PTT systems in common use on amateur radios: simplex and multiplex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplex is used on Kenwood HTs, as well as all HTs that use the Kenwood connector.  This includes most of the cheap Chinese radios flooding the western markets.  It is also the dominant (only?) PTT signaling system used on mobile and base station radios.  It is the PTT signalling mechanism used on the standard MiniDIN-6 packet radio interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplex signalling is used on many hand-held radios and was the dominant signalling method on HTs for a while -- until the Chinese radios standardized on the Kenwood interface.  Most Yaesu, Icom, Alinco and other brands still use this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplex PTT\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplex PTT is rather straight-forward.  A dedicated PTT signal line is held high by a weak pull-up on the radio. When this signal is brought low by connecting it to ground, the transmitter is engaged.  On the TNC, this signal line is connected to ground using a N-channel MOSFET.  When the gate on the MOSFET goes high, the PTT signal is connected to ground through the MOSFET, engaging the transmitter.  The MOSFET gate is pulled low (normally off) with a 100K pull-down resistor.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three components to this circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Q2 - this is a jelly-bean N-Channel MOSFET\n",
    " * R13 - gate resistor\n",
    " * R11 - pull-down resistor\n",
    "\n",
    "The signal from the MCU pin PA12 is active HIGH.  This turns PTT on and off.  The 2N7000 MOSFET connects PTT directly to ground when active.  The 220 Ohm gate resistor R13 is there to prevent gate ringing on the MOSFET and the 100K pull-down resistor R11 is to ensure the PTT connection is OFF even when the MCU pin is not driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mulitplex PTT\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplex PTT relies on applying a DC bias to the radio's MIC+ signal by connecting it to ground through a 2.2K resistor.  The bias is held high by the radio via a weak pull-up resistor internal to the radio.  When the MIC+ line is connected to a 2.2K resistor to ground, this shifts the DC bias down and triggers PTT.  Similar to the simplex PTT circuitry, the multiplex PTT circuit uses an N-channel MOSFET to switch this PTT signal on and off.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four components to this circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Q1 - this is a jelly-bean N-Channel MOSFET\n",
    " * R4 - PTT bias resistor\n",
    " * R6 - gate resistor\n",
    " * R5 - pull-down resistor\n",
    "\n",
    "The signal from the MCU  pin PA11 is active HIGH.  This turns PTT on and off.  The 2N7000 MOSFET connects MIC+ to ground through R4 when active to bias the MIC+ line.  Just like the simples PTT circuit, the 220 Ohm gate resistor R6 is there to prevent gate ringing on the MOSFET and the 100K pull-down resistor R5 is to ensure the PTT connection is OFF even when the MCU pin is not driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EEPROM\n",
    "\n",
    "The TNC requires storage for configuration information (PTT style, KISS parameters, audio twist, etc). The STM32L4 series does not contain an internal EEPROM so we rely on an external EEPROM for this.  The EEPROM uses a 400kHz I2C interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EEPROM circuitry consists of 4 components:\n",
    "\n",
    " * U2 - a 24LC32 32-kbit (4096 byte) EEPROM using an I2C interface\n",
    " * C10 - a 100nF bypass capacitor\n",
    " * R17 and R18 - two 2.2K pull-up resistors on the I2C lines, SDA and SCL\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCL and SDA lines of the EEPROM (U2) are connected to PA7 and PB4 on the MCU respectively.  I2C requires external 2.2K pullups (R17 & R18) on these lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power pins on the EEPROMS are bypassed using a 100nF capacitor (C10).\n",
    "\n",
    "The EEPROM has 3 address pins and a write protect (WP) pins.  We tie all of the address pins to GND to ensure the EEPROM uses the base address value.  The WP pin is tied to GND to ensure that the EEPROM can be written.  We do not need to write protect the EEPROM for this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indicator LEDs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two indicator LEDs.  These are used to indicate transmit, when PTT is enabled, and receive, for data carrier detect (DCD).\n",
    "\n",
    "The DCD LED (D3) is connected to 3.3V via a 470 Ohm current limiting resistor (R19) to its anode, and then to pin PA9 on the MCU, which is configured in open drain mode.  The LED_DCD MCU pin is active low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the TX LED (D4) is connected to 3.3V via a 470 Ohm current limiting resistor (R20) to its anode, and then to pin PA8 on the MCU, which is configured in open drain mode.  The LED_TX MCU pin is active low.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audio Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The audio input has a nominal peak-to-peak voltage limit of 3.3V.  To achieve the best decode performance, it should have at least 200mV peak-to-peak input level.  However it can work with input levels much lower than this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The audio input circuit starts with a DC-blocking capacitor and a programmable DC-offset section required to set the proper DC bias for the audio section. This programmable DC offset is required because there is an additional component of the audio input circuit that is not apparent in the schematic.  There is a built-in programmable gain amplifier (PGA) in the MCU that is used and this requires varying DC offsets depending on the gain selected.  The gain is selectable from 0dB, 6dB, 12dB, 18db, & 24dB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input voltage is limited via two Schottky diodes and then fed into a buffer.  The audio is fed through a 3-pole Bessel anti-aliasing filter with a cut-off of 7200Hz.  This is then fed into the PGA and ADC of the MCU.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of components in this subsection:\n",
    "\n",
    " * C1 - 1uF DC blocking capacitor.*\n",
    " * R1 - 10K DC-offset resistor, along with C1 forms a 15Hz high-pass filter.\n",
    " * D1, D2 - voltage limiter.\n",
    " * U1C - audio buffer.\n",
    " * R7, R10, R14, C4, C6, C8, and U1D - 3-pole active Bessel anti-aliasing filter.\n",
    " \n",
    "C1 was changed in 2021 to a 1uF to improve the low frequency response needed for 9600 baud.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quad op amp U1 is shared across the Audio Input and Audio Output sections.\n",
    " \n",
    "Audio signal from the radio is fed through the capacitor C2 to block DC from the radio.  A DC bias voltage fed in from the MCU's DAC channel 2 (PA5) through a 10K resistor (R1), forming a high-pass filter.  This then passes through a pair of diodes which limit the voltage begin fed into the op-amp.  Amplified audio from a radio's speaker output can easily exceed the voltage limits of the op amp inputs. The op-amp U1C is an audio buffer to provide the low output impedance to feed the anti-aliasing filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The anti-aliasing filter is a low-pass filter designed to limit noise beyond the Nyquist range of the analog to digital converter (ADC) in the microcontroller.  The ADC samples the audio data at 26400 samples per second.  The Nyquist frequency is half the sample rate, or 13.2kHz.   Any noise in the input signal beyond the Nyquist range will be folded back into the sampled data.  The anti-aliasing filter limits the power of the noise outside the Nyquist range by at least 20dB.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing_filter\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the following resources when designing the filter:\n",
    "\n",
    " * http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa049b/sloa049b.pdf\n",
    " * http://sim.okawa-denshi.jp/en/OPstool.php\n",
    "\n",
    "After the anti-alaising filter, the audio enters the MCU.  Inside the MCU is a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) which can amplify the audio signal in discrete steps of 1X (0dB), 2X, 4X, 8X, and 16X.  The DC offset of the amplifier changes based on the amplification level from 1/2 to 1/32 (1.65V - 100mV).  The bias voltage output by DAC channel 2 is adjusted in step with the amplification level by the firmware in the TNC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audio Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Audio output from the TNC is generated by the MCU on DAC channel 1 (PA4).  This is output at 26400 samples per second, resulting in 22 samples per bit.  The output of the DAC looks like stair-steps, with discrete jumps in the various levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the DAC is fed into a low-pass reconstruction filter, which is a 7200Hz, 3-pole Bessel filter, exactly the same as the anti-aliasing filter on the input side.  The output of the reconstruction filter results in a smooth, sine-wave output expected from an audio signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outut of the DAC has about 24dB of dynamic range for output volume control.  Immediately after the reconstruction filter there is a 1/16 voltage divider formed by R8 and R9 resulting in a 24dB attenuation when PB5 is pulled low on the MCU.  This divider give the output stage a range of about 48dB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of filter is then buffered and passes through a decoupling cap C2 to the MIC+ line of the radio.  The resistors R2 and R3 are there to ensure stability of the output stage.  C3 ensures proper isolation from GND.  I cannot find my notes on exactly why these were added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The audio output section has the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    " * R12, R15, R16, C5, C9, C7, U1A - 3-pole Bessel reconstruction filter.\n",
    " * R8, R9 - switchable 24dB audio attenuator.\n",
    " * U1B - buffer.\n",
    " * C2, C3, R2, R3 - AC coupling capacitor and output compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nucleo Board\n",
    "\n",
    "The TNC uses an STM32L432KC Nucleo32 board.  This contains a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F CPU, along with numerous peripherals, 64kB of SRAM and 256KB or flash program memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-L432KC/\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nucleo board presents two interfaces when connected to a computer: a serial interface and a mass storage device.  The mass storage device is used to program the MCU.  Firmware is copied to the mass storage device and instantly uploaded to the microcontroller.  The serial interface connects to pins PA2 (TX) and PA15 (RX).  These two pins are not exposed on the Nucleo board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nucleo board provides power to the breadboard via the +3V3 pin and the two GND pins.  The TNC3 was designed for very low power. The circuitry we will be implementing draws very little additional power from the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The microcontroller can run at up to 80MHz.  For this project we will run the MCU at 48MHz, which is still more than we really need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code for the firmware running on the board can be downloaded from the [Nucleo TNC GitHub repository](https://github.com/mobilinkd/NucleoTNC).\n",

    "\n",
    " * Standard 830 point breadboard (such as an Elenco Model 9425)\n",

It is certainly possible to substitute less expensive components if you have them readily available.  We specify 3mm T-1 LEDs.  You can certainly use 5mm LEDS if that's what you have.  You can replace the MOSFETs with general purpose N-type transistors.  You can also substitute two dual-channel op amps for the one quad op amp.  Just ensure that your op amp has a similar 1MHz bandwidth.  This is required by the active filter.  And you will need to address the layout changes required as a result of any part change.\n",

    "\n",
    "Connect a USB cable from your computer to the Nucleo board.  Be careful with the USB connector on the Nucleo board.  When connected, it should enumerate a number of devices including a removable storage device and a serial port.  For programming, we care about the removable storage device.  On Windows this should appear as a drive letter.  On Linux, this should be mounted somewhere like `/run/media/{USER}/NODE_L432KC`.  And it should appear as a folder on your MacOS desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the `firmware.bin` file from the Mobilinkd GitHub site: https://github.com/mobilinkd/NucleoTNC/releases/tag/v1.0.0\n",

    "<DIV style=\"background-color: #ffffce\">\n",
    "<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Do not tranmit RF near the Nucleo TNC.</span>  Use a dummy load when testing and use an external antenna that is mounted well away from the TNC when operating the TNC on the air.  The long wires used in the assembly of the TNC, and the breadboard itself can act as antennas and will conduct RF energy into the TNC components and any equipment you have attached to it, including your computer.  This may cause the TNC to misbehave and can potentially damage your equipment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Also, when not using a dummy load, it is your responsibility to avoid interfering with others and to announce your callsign.  Use an unused channel, announce that you will be testing, perform the tests, then announce that you are done using the frequency.\n",

    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nucleo TNC presents as a serial port and must be used with the following serial parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    " * 38400 baud, 8N1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Radio Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration of your radio is important.  If you are using an HT, go through the settings and turn everything off that can be turned off.  Power saver settings and VOX must be turned off.  If you are using a Baofeng or other cheap Chinese radio, turn off dual receive, squelch tail elimination, etc.  In general, everything that can be turned off should be turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note about cheap radios.  Most of the cheap radios flooding the market as of late do not work well for general packet use.  The problem is turn-around time -- the time it takes from turning off the transmitter to until the receiver can hear anything.  A good radio has a turn-around time in the 10s of milliseconds.  To be useful for packet radio, it cannot be much more than 100ms.  Most of these cheap radios have turn-around times in the hundreds of milliseconds. Most Boafeng radios are in the 300ms range, which is unusable.  You will miss the response from the remote end.\n",
    "\n",
    "These radios are adequate for running an APRS tracker, where you just want to beacon your position.  The radio will probably miss the first digipeated response but you may not care about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### TNC Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step you will need a computer running Linux (preferrablY), MacOS or Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plug the Nucleo board into the computer.  Note the serial port address (/dev/tty device or COM port) assigned by the operating system.  On Linux this is often /dev/ttyACM0.  On MacOS you should see /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX (where the X's are some number).  On Windows it will be a COM port.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Download Config App\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the Mobilinkd Config App for Linux/MacOS/Windows (TncConfigApp) for serial port.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Adjust the Audio Input Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect the radio to the TNC. Tune to an unused frequency.  Open the squelch on the radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the *Audio Input* section and configure the audio.  An unused channel should have static noise on it.  For an HT, the audio gain on the TNC should be set to 0, and the audio volume on the radio should be adjusted so that the right-most element in the bar graph flickers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are connecting the TNC to a mobile radio's data port and the output level is too low to cause the last LED to flicker, adjust the input gain until the desired level is reached.  If it is still down a few bars, it should still work fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not see any activity in the bar graph, go to the [Testing and Troubleshooting](#Testing-and-Troubleshooting) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The audio input twist should generally be set to 6 for an HT and most mobile radios.  If connected to the discriminator input of a radio (no de-emphasis), set the twist to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "![TncConfigApp Input](TncConfigApp-Input.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjust the Audio Output Levels & PTT\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, you will need another radio (a receiver) tuned to the same frequency as the radio connected to the TNC.  An RTL-SDR is inexpensive and works well for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the *Audio Output* section of the config app to configure the PTT style and output levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the correct PTT signalling method.  Mobile radios and hand-held radios with a Kenwood connector use Simplex PTT signalling.  Most other hand-held radios use Multiplex PTT signalling.  If you don't know, experiment to find the right one.  Select the PTT signalling method and press the *Transmit* button.  The radio should transmit a test tone.  You should see the transmit indicator on the radio light up and you should hear the test tone in the other radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one PTT style does not work, try the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set output volume level, set the tone to 2200Hz and adjust the volume until the tone no longer increases in volume.  For most hand-held radios this will be pretty low (in the 30s or 40s).  Drop the volume level another 10%. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the output twist should be set to \"50\", the midway point.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot trigger PTT or do not hear any audio, go to the [Testing and Troubleshooting](#Testing-and-Troubleshooting) section.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Save Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are done configuring the TNC for your radio, go to the *Save Settings* section and press the \"Save Changes* button.  This will write the configuration values to the board's EEPROM.\n",
